            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Prep onions, garlic, and carrot.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dice onion.</li>
                    <li>You can mince or slice garlic cloves. I prefer slicing thinly (think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQV6CijIzrc" target="_blank">Goodfellas</a>, but doesn't have to be "razor thin")</li>
                    <li>Peel and slice carrot into &#x2153;'s or &#xbc;'s</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Heat a heavy bottomed pot to medium-high heat and brown meat using olive oil. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Add a little more olive oil and saute onions until transluscent. Add garlic and saute until fragrant (30 sec to 1 min).</li>
                <li>Deglaze with red wine, scraping fond off bottom of pan. Cook off alcohol (~5 min). Onions and garlic will look almost gelatenous with wine once ready.</li>
                <li>Add tomato paste and continue to cook (2 - 3 min)</li>
                <li>Add canned tomatoes and mix well. Then add browned meat to pot making sure that all meat is covered.</li>
                <li>Add salt, pepper, carrots and fresh basil to pot. Bring up to temperature then set burner to simmering temp (usually low as you can go). Cover.</li>
                <li>Slow simmer sauce with lid on for 4-6 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>At 4-6 hour mark, take out meat and shred/crush. Add back to pot, stir, and simmer for 30 min to 1 hour.</li>
            </ol>
